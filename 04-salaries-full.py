########## STEP 1: Open and read the URL ##########

url = 'http://mapyourtaxes.mo.gov/MAP/Employees/Employee/searchemployees.aspx'

# Create a new browser object and open the URL
br = Browser()
br.open(url)

########## STEP 2: Select and fill out the appropriate form ##########

# Select the appropriate form, which we'll find by looking in Chrome
br.select_form("ctl01")

# Each control can be set. Dropdown lists are handled as lists, text fields take text
br.form['SearchEmployees1$CalendarYear1$ddlCalendarYear'] = ['2013']
br.form['SearchEmployees1$ddlAgencies'] = ['200']

    # First we need to be sure we're on the correct page, which corresponds to
    # the i in our for loop.

    # We'll select the appropriate form, just like we did before.
    br.select_form("ctl01")

    # Now we just need to nagivate to the page corresponding to i and repeat the process
    br.form['MozillaPager1$ddlPageNumber'] = [str(i)] # Typecast i to string
    br.submit('MozillaPager1$btnPageNumber') # Use the bottom submit button!

    # it for multiple pages, rather than just one.
